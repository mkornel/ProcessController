# Process Controller

A NodeJS process controller to running OS(Operating Sysyem) processes.

## Getting Started

With this NodeJS module you can start OS processes. 
In this project we are starting 3 another NodeJS processes (Express apps), but you can use this controller for any other process to start on your computer (MongoDB, Java, etc.).


### Installing

Run the following line in the project directory:

```
npm install
```

### Try it out

Run the following line in the project directory:

```
node app.js
```

Now the 3 NodeJS Express applications are running and listening on port 3001, 3002 and 3003. 
Also a processes.inf file is created where you can find the process IDs.
